# Project-P1

This is a **first-semester** project made by a group and me at Aalborg University. The aim of the project is to develop a software application in the C programming language that facilitates automatic bargain hunting. The application will allow users to input a shopping list and search for the lowest total price of the items on the list at nearby stores. It uses simulated/custom data for demonstration purposes.

### IDE
For this project, the 'Clion' Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) was utilized. 'Clion' is a cross-platform IDE that is specifically designed for C and C++ development. It offers a range of features including code navigation, code refactoring, debugging, and code completion, which make it a powerful tool for developing C and C++ applications. 'Clion' also integrates with popular build systems such as CMake and Gradle, allowing for easy compilation and execution of projects. Overall, 'Clion' proved to be a reliable and efficient choice for this project.
